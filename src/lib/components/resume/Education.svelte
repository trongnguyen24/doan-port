		<p>I am Doan (ƒêoan) - a Graphic Designer based in Saigon, Vietnam.</p>
		<p>
			I enjoy playing around with layouts and typography, and I have a certain amount of fondness
			for photography. In terms of illustration, I tend to stylise everything geometrically and fill
			them with vibrant colours. I am a rookie in the 3D field, but I am more than willing to learn,
			and do it without cease.
